First find a repo and clone it. (git clone https://...)
Then add the file that I've changed (git add <filename>
Then commit the file I've changed (git commit -m "My Message")
Then push the changes to github (git push)
Note: if a file has spaces in it, then put quotes "File name here" around it.  Folders are single apostrophes 'folder name'
small change
